* Supports the following languages:
  * Ruby
  * Python
  * Rust
  * [...add more!](https://github.com/repotag/cutting_edge/wiki/Languages)
* Supports the following platforms:
  * GitHub
  * Gitlab (both gitlab.com and [self-hosted instances](#Adding-self-hosted-repository-servers))
  * Gitea ([self-hosted](#Adding-self-hosted-repository-servers))
  * Both public and [private repositories](#Authorization-and-private-repositories)

**View the web front end of a [live instance](https://dometto-cuttingedge.herokuapp.com/)**.
 
## Requirements

CuttingEdge is lightweight and easy to deploy: 

* No database required
  * you can optionally use [data stores like Redis](#Using-Redis-and-other-data-stores)
* Simple configuration through a `projects.yml` file
* Requires relatively few resources (~120MB RAM), so...
* It can even run on [Heroku](#Deploying-on-Heroku)'s free plan!

## Installation

Simply:

```
$ gem install cutting_edge
$ cutting_edge
```

Or run from source:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/repotag/cutting_edge.git
$ cd cutting_edge
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec cutting_edge
```

Before running, define your repositories in [projects.yml](#projects-yml). You may also want to change some settings in [config.rb](#config-rb).

### Deploying on Heroku

CuttingEdge runs out of the box on Heroku, and is lightweight enough to function on the Heroku free plan. This repository already contains the `Procfile` needed for deployment.

**Note: on Heroku, CuttingEdge uses `heroku.config.rb` instead of `config.rb`**.

Steps:

1. Clone/fork this repository, as it already contains some settings (in `heroku.config.rb`) relevant to Heroku
1. Edit `projects.yml` and commit it to the repo
1. `heroku create my-cuttingedge`
1. `heroku config:add HEROKU_APP_NAME=my-cuttingedge`
1. `git push heroku master`
1. *Optional, if you want to receive [email notifications](#Email-Notifications)*:
  * `heroku addons:create mailgun:starter`
  * `heroku config:add CUTTING_EDGE_MAIL_TO=mydependencies@mydependencymonitoring.com`
  * If you are on the free plan: [add your email addresses as Authorized Recipients](https://help.mailgun.com/hc/en-us/articles/217531258-Authorized-Recipients) in [Mailgun](https://app.mailgun.com/) (login via Heroku)

You may also want to set some [Heroku config variables](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars), for instance to [use authentication tokens](#Authorization-and-private-repositories) in `heroku.config.rb`.

Note that Heroku switches off apps running on their free plan when they idle, so you may want to look at [this](https://medium.com/better-programming/keeping-my-heroku-app-alive-b19f3a8c3a82).

## Usage

When your instance of CuttingEdge is running, you can visit the landing page by pointing your browser to the root URL of the app. Locally, it is by default accessible at:

`http://localhost:4567/`

(Of course, you can also bind it to port 80 or 443 and make it accessible from the internet using the `--port` and `--host` arguments. Or you could place Apache or nginx in front of CuttingEdge.)

An instance on Heroku will be accessible through:

`https://your-app-name.herokuapp.com/`

### projects.yml

`projects.yml` is the file in which you define which repositories you want CuttingEdge to monitor. Here's an example:

```yaml
github:
  my_org:
    my_project:
      language: ruby
```

This will make CuttingEdge monitor the GitHub project `my_org/my_project`. You can add multiple repositories under the `github:` key, and also use the `gitlab:` key for repositories on gitlab.com out of the box. If you [add self-hosted providers](#Adding-self-hosted-repository-servers), you'll be able to define repositories using, for instance, `my_gitea:`.

 The `language:` key can currently be set to `ruby` (default), `rust`, or `python`. Further supported keys:

* `auth_token`: see [here](#Authorization-and-private-repositories)
* `hide`: see [here](#Hide-repositories)
* `locations`: use to change the default path to dependency definition files. For instance, for a Ruby project, CuttingEdge will by default try to monitor `Gemfile` and `my_project.gemspec`. You can override this with `language: [Gemfile, alternative/file.gemspec]`
* `branch`: use a different branch than the default `master`
* `email`:
  * disable email notifications for a single project by setting this to `false`
  * use a non-default address delivery address for this project by setting this to e.g. `myproject@mydependencymonitoring.com`

Note: by default CuttingEdge will use `projects.yml` in the working directory. You may optionally specify a different path by running `cutting_edge path/to/my_projects.yml`.

Instead of `projects.yml`, you can also [define projects in `config.rb`](#Defining-repositories-in-configrb).

### config.rb

To configure CuttingEdge specific settings in `config.rb`, you can run `cutting_edge` with the `--config` switch (you can optionally specify an alternative location for the config file). Always make sure you are defining your settings from within the `CuttingEdge` module. For instance:

```ruby
module CuttingEdge
  REFRESH_SCHEDULE = '2h'
end
```

The sample [config.rb](config.rb) contains some examples of constants that you may wish to configure. Here are some descriptions of what the less obvious ones achieve:

* `SECRET_TOKEN`: set a global secret token for administrative purposes. This token is used to configure [hooks](#Refreshing-dependency-status-through-git-hooks), and to list [hidden projects](#Hide-Repositories).
* `SERVER_URL`: the link to the app that should be displayed, for instance in emails. Defaults to `"http://#{SERVER_HOST}"`
* `MAIL_TEMPLATE`: override the [ERB](https://www.stuartellis.name/articles/erb/) template used to render [emails](#Email-Notifications). See [mail.html.erb](lib/cutting_edge/templates/mail.html.erb) for an example on which variables you can use within the template.

### Email Notifications

CuttingEdge can send email notifications whenever a change in the dependency status of a monitored project is detected. This is disabled by default. Enable it in `config.rb`:

```ruby
module CuttingEdge
  MAIL_TO = 'mydeps@mymail.com'  # Default address to send email to. If set to false (=default!), don't send any emails except for repositories that have their 'email:' attribute set in projects.yml
  MAIL_FROM = "cutting_edge@my_server.com" # From Address used for sending emails.
end
```

By default, the app wil try to use an SMTP server on `localhost:25`. Change these settings in your `config.rb` by calling `Mail.defaults`:

```ruby
# This should be outside the module CuttingEdge
Mail.defaults do
  delivery_method :smtp, address: "localhost", port: 1025
end
```

See [the mail gem](https://github.com/mikel/mail#sending-an-email) for more information.

You can switch off email notifications for a single project by setting its `email:` key to `false` in [projects.yml](#projects-yml). Alternatively, you can set the `email:` key for a single project to a different address than the default `MAIL_TO`.

### Adding self-hosted repository servers

You can monitor projects on your own self-hosted Gitlab or Gitea instances. To do so, you need to tell CuttingEdge about your server by editing `config.rb` as follows:

```ruby
module CuttingEdge
    require './lib/cutting_edge/repo.rb'
    define_gitlab_server('mygitlab', 'https://mygitlab.com')
    define_gitea_server('mygitea', 'https://mygitea.com')
end
```

This will allow you to use the `mygitlab:` and `mygitea:` keys in `projects.yml`, for instance like so:

```yaml
mygitlab:
  myorg:
    project-name:
      lang: rust
mygitea:
  myorg2:
    project-name2:
      lang: python
```

Don't forget to run CuttingEdge with the `--config` option!

### Authorization and private repositories

If you want to monitor dependencies in a private (e.g. GitHub or Gitlab) project, you can instruct CuttingEdge to use an API token for accessing the dependency files. In `projects.yml`:

```yaml
github:
   secret-org:
     secret-repo:
       auth_token: 'mysecrettoken'
```

For info on generating API tokens, see:

* [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token)
* [Gitlab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html)
* [Gitea](https://docs.gitea.io/en-us/api-usage/)

### Defining repositories in config.rb

If you don't want to expose information about a project in (**such as an [API token](#Authorization-and-private-repositories)!**) `projects.yml` (which may be publically accessible on the internet), you can instead define your project repository programatically in `config.rb`. This will allow you to define repositories with secret parameters by (for instance) utilising environment variables:

```ruby
module CuttingEdge
    require './lib/cutting_edge/repo.rb'
    REPOSITORIES = {
      "gitlab/#{ENV['SECRET_REPO1_ORG']}/#{ENV['SECRET_REPO1_NAME']}" => GitlabRepository.new(org: ENV['SECRET_REPO1_ORG'], name: ENV['SECRET_REPO1_NAME'], auth_token: ENV['SECRET_REPO1_AUTH_TOKEN'], hide: ENV['SECRET_REPO1_HIDE_TOKEN'])
    }
end
```

This approach is especially useful on Heroku, where you can use [Heroku config variables](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars).

### Hide Repositories

You may want the name and dependency monitoring information for private repositories (see above) not to be visible on the internet. To achieve this, you can use `hide: token` in `projects.yml`:

```yaml
github:
   secret-org:
     secret-repo:
       auth_token: 'mysecrettoken'
       hide: 'myhiddenrepo'
```

...or again, you can do so in `config.rb` following the [method explained above](#Defining-repositories-in-configrb):

```ruby
GitlabRepository.new(org: ENV['SECRET_REPO1_ORG'], name: ENV['SECRET_REPO1_NAME'], auth_token: ENV['SECRET_REPO1_AUTH_TOKEN'], hide: ENV['SECRET_REPO1_HIDE_TOKEN'])
end
```

Setting the `hide` key to a token of your choice will ensure that:

1. your hidden repo is not listed in the web frontend.
  * to list all hidden repositories, you can enter your `CuttingEdge::SECRET_TOKEN` after clicking the "List hidden repositories" on the landing page.
  * **NB: this is your [global administrator token](#configrb), not the particular token used to hide a particular project.** 
2. the `/info` route and SVG image for your hidden repo are not accessible without the repo-specific token you have set via `hide:`

When you go to the `/info` route for your hidden repo (by first entering your administrator token, then clicking on the SVG for the project), you can click the "Embed" button and thereby acquire a link to the SVG dependency status image that contains the `hide:` token. You can thus use this link on a private repository, without giving collaborators on that project access to information about your other hidden repositories!

### Refreshing dependency status through git hooks

CuttingEdge by default checks whether the status of your dependencies has changed once every hour. However, if you wish, you can also setup hooks so that dependency status is checked (for instance) whenever you make a commit to your project.

For this purpose, CuttingEdge provides the following route:

```
http://mycuttingedge.com/github/org/myproject/refresh?token=mysecrettoken
```

An HTTP `POST` request to that route will cause the dependencies for that project to refresh. This requires you to define a secret token in `config.rb`, so that third parties cannot trigger refreshes. In `config.rb`:

```ruby
module CuttingEdge
  CuttingEdge::SECRET_TOKEN = 'mysecrettoken' # Note: this token is used to refresh all the projects on your CuttingEdge instance
end
```

Using this route you can, for instance, set up a [GitHub Action](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions) (or equivalent for other providers). Of course, this requires defining the secret token as (for instance) a [GitHub Secret](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets).

You can test the route like this:

```
curl -d 'token=mysecrettoken' http://mycuttingedge.com/github/org/myproject/refresh
```

## Using Redis and other data stores

CuttingEdge does not require persistence, as the data it uses (which dependencies does a project have, and are they up to date?) is refreshed periodically anyway. By default, this information is stored in memory. However, if you would like to store data in a different kind of data store (for instance Redis) that can be trivially accomplished. This may further decrease the amount of RAM CuttingEdge requires, and possibly improve performance.

CuttingEdge uses [Moneta](https://github.com/moneta-rb/moneta) as an abstraction layer for its data store, so to change the data store can just do the following in `config.rb`:

```ruby
module CuttingEdge
  STORE = Moneta.new(:Redis)
end
```

See the [Moneta](https://github.com/moneta-rb/moneta) instructions.

Note that Heroku offers a free [Redis Add-on](https://elements.heroku.com/addons/heroku-redis).
