    # Such cases would be caused by the fact that we are generating `check_version` below by chopping off the version decimals after `position`
    # For example: `latest_version` is 3.5. On the first pass of this loop, we will thus be checking version 3.0.
    # This would fail a ~> 3.2 requirement on the first pass, falsely yielding an `:outdated_major`.
