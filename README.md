CuttingEdge monitors the status of the dependencies of your projects and lets you know when any of them go out of date.

## Features

* Generates badge images that you can include in your projects' Readme, like the one above!
* Can send you email when the status of a project's dependencies changes
* Serves a simple [info page](https://dometto-cuttingedge.herokuapp.com/github/repotag/cutting_edge/info) detailing the status of each project
* Supports the following languages:
  * Ruby
  * Python
  * Rust
  * [add more!]()
* Supports the following platforms:
  * GitHub
  * Gitlab (both gitlab.com and [self-hosted instances](#Adding-self-hosted-repository-servers))
  * Gitea ([self-hosted](#Adding-self-hosted-repository-servers))
  * Both public and [private repositories](#Authorization-and-private-repositories)

**View the web front end of a [live instance](https://dometto-cuttingedge.herokuapp.com/)**.
 
## Requirements

CuttingEdge is lightweight and easy to deploy: 

* No database required
* Simple configuration through a `projects.yml` file
* Requires relatively few resources (~120MB RAM), so...
* It can even run on Heroku's free plan!

## Installation

Simply:

```
$ gem install cutting_edge
$ cutting_edge
```

Or run from source:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/repotag/cutting_edge.git
$ cd cutting_edge
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec cutting_edge
```

Before running, define your repositories in [projects.yml](#projects-yml). You may also want to change some settings in [config.rb](#config-rb).

### Deploying on Heroku

CuttingEdge runs out of the box on Heroku, and is lightweight enough to function on the Heroku free plan. We recommend you:

1. Clone/fork [this](ADD URL TO HEROKU EXAMPLE) repository, as it already contains some `config.rb` settings relevant to Heroku
2. Edit `projects.yml` and commit it to the repo
3. `heroku create my-cuttingedge`
4. `git push heroku master`

You may also want to set some [Heroku config variables](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars), for instance to [use authentication tokens](#Authorization-and-private-repositories) in `config.rb`.

## Usage

When your instance of CuttingEdge is running, you can visit the landing page by pointing your browser to the root URL of the app. Locally, it is by default accessible at:

`http://localhost:4567/`

(Of course, you can also bind it to port 80 or 443 and make it accessible from the internet using the `--port` and `--host` arguments. Or you could place Apache or nginx in front of CuttingEdge.)

An instance on Heroku will be accessible through:

`https://your-app-name.herokuapp.com/`

### projects.yml

Explain language, locations key.

### config.rb

To configure CuttingEdge specific settings in `config.rb`, you can run `cutting_edge` with the `--config` switch (you can also specify an alternative location for the config file). Always make sure you are defining your settings from within the `CuttingEdge` module. For instance:

```ruby
module CuttingEdge
  REFRESH_SCHEDULE = '2h'
end
```

The sample [config.rb](config.rb) contains (within its comments) some examples of constants that you may wish to configure. Here are some descriptions of what the less obvious ones achieve:

* `SECRET_TOKEN`: set a global secret token for administrative purposes. This token is used to configure [hooks](#Refreshing dependency-status-through-git-hooks), and to list [hidden projects](#Hide-Repositories).

### Email Notifications

### Adding self-hosted repository servers

You can monitor projects on your own, self-hosted Gitlab or Gitea instances. To do so, you need to tell CuttingEdge about your server by editing `config.rb` as follows:

```ruby
module CuttingEdge
    require './lib/cutting_edge/repo.rb'
    define_gitlab_server('mygitlab', 'https://mygitlab.com')
    define_gitea_server('mygitea', 'https://mygitea.com')
end
```

This will allow you to use the `mygitlab:` and `mygitea:` keys in `projects.yml`, for instance like so:

```yaml
github:
   repotag:
     cutting_edge:
       lang: ruby
mygitlab:
  myorg:
    project-name:
      lang: rust
mygitea:
  myorg2:
    project-name2:
      lang: python
```

Don't forget to run CuttingEdge with the `--config` option!

### Authorization and private repositories

If you want to monitor dependencies in a private (e.g. GitHub or Gitlab) project, you can instruct CuttingEdge to use an API token for accessing the dependency files. In `projects.yml`:

```yaml
github:
   secret-org:
     secret-repo:
       auth_token: 'mysecrettoken'
```

For info on generating API tokens, see:

* [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token)
* [Gitlab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html)
* [Gitea](https://docs.gitea.io/en-us/api-usage/)

If you don't want to expose your API token in `project.yml` (**which you shouldn't** when it is publicly accessible on the internet), you can instead define your project repository programatically in `config.rb`. This will allow you to set secrets (auth_token, but if desired also name and org of the repository) by (for instance) utilising environment variables:

```ruby
module CuttingEdge
    require './lib/cutting_edge/repo.rb'
    REPOSITORIES = {
      "gitlab/#{ENV['SECRET_REPO1_ORG']}/#{ENV['SECRET_REPO1_NAME']}" => GitlabRepository.new(org: ENV['SECRET_REPO1_ORG'], name: ENV['SECRET_REPO1_NAME'], auth_token: ENV['SECRET_REPO1_AUTH_TOKEN'], hide: ENV['SECRET_REPO1_HIDE_TOKEN'])
    }
end
```

This approach is especially useful on Heroku, where you can use [Heroku config variables](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars).

### Hide Repositories

You may want the name and dependency monitoring information for private repositories (see above) not to be visible on the internet. To achieve this, you can use `hide: token` in `projects.yml`:

```yaml
github:
   secret-org:
     secret-repo:
       auth_token: 'mysecrettoken'
       hide: 'myhiddenrepo'
```

...or again, you can do so in `config.rb` following the [method explained above](#Authorization-and-private-repositories):

```ruby
GitlabRepository.new(org: ENV['SECRET_REPO1_ORG'], name: ENV['SECRET_REPO1_NAME'], auth_token: ENV['SECRET_REPO1_AUTH_TOKEN'], hide: ENV['SECRET_REPO1_HIDE_TOKEN'])
end
```

Setting the `hide` key to a token of your choice will ensure that:

1. your hidden repo is not listed in the web frontend.
  * to list all hidden repositories, you can enter your `CuttingEdge::SECRET_TOKEN` after clicking the "List hidden repositories" on the landing page.
  * **NB: this is your global administrator token not the particular token used to hide a particular project.** 
2. the `/info` route and SVG image for your hidden repo are not accessible without the repo-specific token you have set via `hide:`

When you go to the `/info` route for your hidden repo (by first entering your administrator token, then clicking on the SVG for the project), you can click the "Embed" button and thereby acquire a link to the SVG dependency status image that contains the `hide:` token. You can thus use this link on a private repository, without giving collaborators on that project access to information about your other hidden repositories!

### Refreshing dependency status through git hooks

CuttingEdge by default checks whether the status of your dependencies has changed once every hour. However, if you wish, you can also setup hooks so that dependency status is checked (for instance) whenever you make a commit to your project.

For this purpose, CuttingEdge provides the following route:

```
http://mycuttingedge.com/github/org/myproject/refresh?token=mysecrettoken
```

An HTTP `POST` request to that route will cause the dependencies for that project to refresh. This requires you to define a secret token in `config.rb`, so that third parties cannot trigger refreshes. In `config.rb`:

```ruby
module CuttingEdge
  CuttingEdge::SECRET_TOKEN = 'mysecrettoken' # Note: this token is used to refresh all the projects on your CuttingEdge instance
end
```

Using this route you can, for instance, set up a [GitHub Action](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions) (or equivalent for other providers). Of course, this requires defining the secret token as (for instance) a [GitHub Secret](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets).

You can test the route like this:

```
curl -d 'token=mysecrettoken' http://mycuttingedge.com/github/org/myproject/refresh
```
