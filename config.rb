# # The following will allow you to define projects on your own GitLab or Gitea server in projects.yml
# # This will allow you to use the 'mygitlab' and 'mygitea' keys, respectively, in projects.yml

#   define_gitea_server('mygitea', 'https://mygitea.com')

#   #     projectname:
#   #       language: rust
#   #     ruby_project:

# # You may also define additional repositories programatically as follows.
# # These will be added to the repositories defined in projects.yml.
